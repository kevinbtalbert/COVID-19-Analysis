### 3. Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge
Because of the nature of the research, the business problem is to illuminate valuable insight into the COVID-19 Pandemic and use the data in AWS' Open Data Registry to draw analyses about COVID-19 impact and effect.

COVID-19 has significantly impacted the way of life for many people across the globe. This dataset is fascinating for multiple reasons since it reveals aggregated data from a number of recognized data sources including the World Health Organization, the New York Times, and US COVID-19 Tracking Project.
The topic is not only relevant but very crucial as COVID-19 is a pandemic effecting many today. The dataset is current and updated twice daily, according to the Registry of Open Data on AWS.

### 4. Research Objectives and Question(s)
I am interested in comparing National and State-level US COVID-19 data, particularly with respect to metadata such as geographic locations, population in states, population among age group, and population by counties. While there are a number of questions which may introduce themselves during my research, the primary nature of the below questions are aimed at analysis and usage by stakeholders such as data scientists and academics but will be presented with an end-user in mind.

~ What are the states with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases?
~ Of the known demographics in the dataset, what contributes significantly to COVID-19 deaths?
~ At what time were cases the highest?
~ What statistics can be observed from the dataset?
